# VirtualProduction-GettingStarted
Getting started with the NCCA Virtual Production configuration.
Note this is for our inhouse system in PG25 and the PGB sound stage.

It uses Motion Analysis for the camera tracking and the version is currently fixed at UE4.25 for compatibility reasons.

Be sure to check out the Wiki associated with this Repo for details about setting up the overall system.
